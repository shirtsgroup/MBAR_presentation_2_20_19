In order to run this script to work I had to override one hard-coded option in OpenMM.

More specifically, I had to comment out line 692 of: anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/simtk/openmm/app/gromacstopfile.py:
"has_nbfix_terms = any([pair in self._nonbondTypes for pair in combinations_with_replacement(sorted(set(atom_types)), 2)])"
